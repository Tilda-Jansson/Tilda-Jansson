## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffanyâ€™s at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. Itâ€™s priceless. As Iâ€™m taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. Itâ€™s her fatherâ€™s business. Sheâ€™s Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come, and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I donâ€™t trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son, and heâ€™s the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. Sheâ€™s been waiting for me all these years. Sheâ€™s never taken another lover. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t show up. I go to Berlin. Thatâ€™s where I stashed the chandelier.
