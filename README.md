## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> I bought it.  Itâ€™s ours.  Letâ€™s go inside, Iâ€™ll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, Iâ€™m actually not allowed in here soâ€¦ [shuts the door]
