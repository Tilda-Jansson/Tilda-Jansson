## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> Thatâ€™s crazy.  Thatâ€™s crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepinâ€™ with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  Thatâ€™s a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Rightâ€¦ what is wrong.  Whoâ€™s to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it isâ€¦ unknowable.  But, letâ€™s give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
