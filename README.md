Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There’s a point there. But what is the point? I don’t understand what he’s saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it’s not a little foggy there’s actually something going on here-
