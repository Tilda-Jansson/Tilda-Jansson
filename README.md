## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d like to do.  Iâ€™d like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  Iâ€™ll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  Thatâ€™s how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredithâ€™s drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we donâ€™t say anything sheâ€™s not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.
