## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> [on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. Iâ€™ll talk to youâ€¦ [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. â€¦ No, he didnâ€™t! He is alive. And this isnâ€™t even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you canâ€™t return it. Or can you? No you canâ€™t. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
