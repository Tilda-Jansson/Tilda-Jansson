## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Orâ€¦ thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people donâ€™t believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So Iâ€™m gonna go inside. Iâ€™m going to make some calls, Iâ€™m gonna get us an office space, and Iâ€™m going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]
