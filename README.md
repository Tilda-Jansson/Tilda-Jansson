## ðŸ“£ Office quote

> Todayâ€™s a big day.  Todayâ€™s the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But itâ€™s my parentâ€™s house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  Itâ€™s got shag carpets.  I mean you canâ€™t blame my parents it was the 70â€™s.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  Sheâ€™s gonna love it.  Right?
